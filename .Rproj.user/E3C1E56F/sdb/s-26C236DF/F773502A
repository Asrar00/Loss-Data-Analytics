See the [Open Actuarial Textbooks Project Site](https://sites.google.com/a/wisc.edu/loss-data-analytics/) for more information about this project.\n\n# Loss Data Analytics\n\n**Book Description** - *Loss Data Analytics* will be an interactive, online, freely available text.\n* The online version will contain many interactive objects (quizzes, computer demonstrations, interactive graphs, video, and the like) to promote deeper learning.\n* A subset of the book will be available for offline reading in pdf and EPUB formats.\n* The online text will be available in multiple languages to promote access to a worldwide audience.\n\nTo see our progress, a draft of a few chapters of the book is available at \n*  [Online Version from R Bookdown](http://instruction.bus.wisc.edu/jfrees/UWCAELearn/LossDataAnalytics/index.html). \n* [R Bookdown - pdf version](http://instruction.bus.wisc.edu/jfrees/UWCAELearn/LossDataAnalytics/LossDataAnaytics.pdf)\n* [R Bookdown - EPUB version](http://instruction.bus.wisc.edu/jfrees/UWCAELearn/LossDataAnalytics/LossDataAnalytics.epub)\n\nSoon, we will put the source code for these files on Github.\n\nWe are also experimenting with a [WordPress site](http://www.ssc.wisc.edu/~jfrees/loss-data-analytics/).\n\n# R Codes for Loss Data Analytics\n\nThis site provides files that generate *R* codes to support the online text **Loss Data Analytics**. To get an idea of what the files will generate for users, see the [Online Version from R Code Support](http://instruction.bus.wisc.edu/jfrees/UWCAELearn/LossDataAnalyticsRcode/index.html)\n\nSource code is available at our [GitHub site](https://github.com/ewfrees/LossDataAnalyticsRCode).\n\n\n# Life Contingencies / Actuarial Mathematics\n\nWe are also starting to organize several sets of notes for *Life Contingencies*, also known as *Actuarial Mathematics* and *Long Term Actuarial Mathematics*. See our [GitHub Site](https://github.com/ewfrees/LifeCon).\n",
