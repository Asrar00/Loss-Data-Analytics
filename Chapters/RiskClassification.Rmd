## Introduction 

Through insurance contracts, the policyholders effectively transfer their risks to the insurer in exchange for premiums. For the insurer to stay in business, the premium income collected from a pool of policyholders must at least equal to the benet outgo. Ignoring the frictional expenses associated with the administrative cost and the prot margin, the net premium thus should be equal to the expected loss occurring from the risk that is transferred from the policyholder to the insurer.

If all policyholders in the insurance pool have identical risk profiles, the insurer may simply charge the same premium for each policyholder because all of them would have the same expected loss. In reality however the policyholders are hardly homogeneous. For example, mortality risk in life insurance depends on the characteristics of the policyholder, such as, age, sex and life style. In auto insurance, those characteristics may include age, occupation, the type or use of the car, and the area where the driver resides. The knowledge of these characteristics or variables of individual policyholders can enhance the ability of calculating a fair premium as they can be used to estimate or predict the expected losses more accurately at the individual level. Indeed, if the insurer do not differentiate the risk characteristics of individual policyholders and simply charges the same premium to all individuals based on the average characteristic of the portfolio, the insurer would face adverse selection, a situation where individuals with a higher chance of loss are attracted in the portfolio and low-risk individuals are repelled.

For example, consider a health insurance industry where smoking status is an important risk factor for mortality and morbidity. Most health insurers in the industry require different premiums depending on smoking status, so smokers pay higher premiums than non-smokers, with other characteristics being identical. Now suppose that there is an insurer, we will call EquitabAll, that offers the same premium to all insureds regardless of smoking status, unlike other competitors. The net premium of EquitabAll is natually an average mortality loss accounting for both smokers and non-smokers; the average is a weighted one using the proportion of smokers and non-smokers. Thus it is easy to see that that a smoker would have a good incentive to purchase insurance from EquitabAll than other insurers as the offered premium by EquitabAll is relatively lower. At the same time non-smokers would prefer buying insurance from somewhere else where lower premiums, computed from the non-smoker group only, are offered. The result of this tendency for the EquitabAll's insurance portfolio is that there will be more smokers and less non-smokers in the pool, which leads to larger-than-expected mortality losses and hence a higher premium for insureds in the next period to cover the higher costs. With the raised new premium in the next period, non-smokers in EquitabAll will have even greater incentives to switch the insurer. As the cycle continues over time, EquitabAll would gradually retain more smokers in its portfolio with the premium continually raised, and this vicious cycle eventually leads to a collapsing of business. In the literature this phenomenon is known as the adverse selection spiral or death spiral.
Therefore, incorporating and differentiating important risk characteristics of individuals in the insurance pricing process are a pertinent component for both the determination of fair premium for each policyholder and the long term sustainability of an insurer.


In order to incorporate relevant risk characteristics of policyholders in the pricing process insurers maintain some classification system that assigns each policyholder to one of the risk classes based on a relatively small number of risk characteristics that are deemed most relevant. These characteristics used in the classification system are called the rating factors, which are a priori variables in the sense that they are known before the contract begins (e.g., sex, health status, vehicle type, etc, are known during the underwriting process). All policyholders sharing identical risk factors thus are assigned to the same risk class, and are considered homogeneous; the insurer consequently charge them the same premium.

An important task in any risk classification is to construct a quantitative model that can determine the expected loss given various rating factors for a policyholder. The standard approach is to adopt a statistical regression model which produces the expected loss as the output when the relevant risk factors are given as the inputs. We introduce and discuss the Poisson regression, which can be used when the loss is a count variable, as a prominent example of an insurance pricing tool under risk classification schemes.
